      Bettering yourself starts with confidence which is greatly influenced by how good you feel you look. Firstly, staying hydrated makes a huge difference to the appearance of your skin. Try drinking 1.5 litres of water everday and avoiding any other drinks (especially alcohol!). Shakespear never underestimated sleep and neither should you. Try and aim for 7-8 hours everynight. To help, turn off all appliances an hour before bed and have some dim lighting. This can make all the difference. Use some coconut oil as a mask overnight for softer feeling hair and invest in an aloe vera plant to occasionally use on your skin to help clear it up.

      <h5 class="mt-0 mb-1">Health</h5>
      Health can often be overlooked when life gets busy. Although it may feel like you're getting by in the moment, not looking after yourself can have long-term consequences. The advice here is to wake up in the morning and do some gentle streching, even if just for five minutes. This will help keep you flexible and prepare your body for the day. It's also extremely relaxing (a good mindfulness excercise). You don't have to become obsessed with the gym but try and get a workout plan going, even if you only get round to it two or three times every week. Consistency is key when it comes to exercise and if you keep it up you are sure to see results. Lastly, my personal favourite tip when it comes to health is investing in a juicer. Juicing is a great way to get goodness into your body and can taste really good. There are lots of recipes online that explain the specific health benefits of different fruits and veg.

      <h5 class="mt-0 mb-1">Mindfulness</h5>
      This is one of the most important parts of self help, helping the mind. Mindfulness has become increasingly popular over the recent years however it is not just another fad. Taking time everyday to clear your mind and ground yourself can make a huge difference to the way you handle situations and feel in general. You do not have to meditate for hours and hire someone to play the gong. Taking a few moments when you wake up, before bed, or whenever you have time during the day can help you massively. Clear your mind and play some meditation music in the background. For beginners guided meditations are very helpful in maintaing focus and not feeling lost. There are also lots of other ways you can be mindful, just by thinking of what has made you happy today or stopping and taking note of what you can hear at that moment are good examples of being mindful. It does not have to be difficult and is a small change that can help you better your mental state.
